1 - *--- Technologies used ---*

- React -  front-end development
- Ruby on Rails - back-end development
- Postgres - managing database

2 - *--- Approach ---*
I wanted to create a similar project that we have already done for the Full-stack Course (Airbnb and Twitter clones), but a different industry. Supr Eats App is similar to Airbnb that it connects different type of users, but still will be challenging to add the menu items and prices and to add the cart functionality (which I have actually practiced as we built the "Shopping Cart" project earlier). I also wanted to practice Stripe integration and payment success functionalities as majority of the web apps nowadays require ecommerce setup.

3 major features include: 
  Feature 1 - Restaurants list for the user to browse all the restaurant options and pick their preferred option
  Feature 2 - Restaurants menu page for the user to see menu items of the restaurant and to pick the items they want to order
  Feature 3 - Cart and checkout for the user to see the selection and total bill before checkout, they can remove items from the cart if they want to, then they will finalize the order with Stripe payment


3 - *--- Installation instructions ---*
- "rails db:migrate" - to run the migrations
- "rails db:seed" - to run the db/seed.rb file which includes seeded data
- "Rails s" - to start the server

4 - *--- User stories ---*
Currently 

Users ordering the food will need the website to order food from the comfort of their home. They don't feel like eating out, but they also don't want to cook at home. They want to see all the restaurant options and pick the food of their preference, they want an easy checkout process.
