Super Eats App is a capstone project for Altcademy Full-Stack Course project.

Super Eats is an online food ordering and delivery platform that connects customers and food sector business owners.

1 - *--- Technologies used ---*

- React -  front-end development
- Ruby on Rails - back-end development
- Postgres - managing database

2 - *--- Approach ---*
I wanted to create a similar project that we have already done for the Full-stack Course (Airbnb and Twitter clones), but a different industry. Supr Eats App is similar to Airbnb that it connects different type of users, but still will be challenging to add the menu items and prices and to add the cart functionality (which I have actually practiced as we built the "Shopping Cart" project earlier). I also wanted to practice Stripe integration and payment success functionalities as majority of the web apps nowadays require ecommerce setup.

Major features include: 
- Feature 1 - Restaurants list for the user to browse all the restaurant options and pick their preferred option
- Feature 2 - Restaurants menu page for the user to see menu items of the restaurant and to pick the items they want to order
- Feature 3 - Cart and checkout for the user to see the selection and total bill before checkout, they can remove items from the cart if they want to, then they will finalize the order with Stripe payment

3 - *--- Installation instructions ---*
- "rails db:migrate" - to run the migrations
- "rails db:seed" - to run the db/seed.rb file which includes seeded data
- "Rails s" - to start the server

4 - *--- User stories ---*
Users ordering the food will need the website to order food from the comfort of their home. They don't feel like eating out, but they also don't want to cook at home. They want to see all the restaurant options and pick the food of their preference, they want an easy checkout process. They want to see all their orders in one place.

5 - *--- Wireframes ---*

6 - *--- Challenges and Learnings ---*
Challenge 1 - understandig how databases are related to one another and how they communicate as the project gets bigger.

Learning - planning stage is extremely important, when you have the structure and logic down on paper first, then building the app is going to be very easy. Some points in my project I left for "figuring out as I go", and it took me a lot of time to plan them later, and/or had to change the code across components mutiple times.

Challenge 2 - adding too many new features that I don't know how they work and/or how to execute them, and being overly confident "I will figure it out".

Learning - keep the project 80% of what you know and 20% learn something new while building the project, this way you can practice what you already know, ad at the same time learn some new bits here and there, but the new learnigs don't become overwhelming. Again, planning stage will be helpful.
